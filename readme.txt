== Description ==
The site icon widget is a simple way to display your site icon on your site itself. By default, site icons aren't displayed anywhere on your site because they're used externally;this plugin is an easier way to show it on the site without a clumsy image widget plugin, and to make sure you icon gets updated everywhere when it's changed.

Note that site icons must be square and that their primary purpose is to be used as browser and device icons. However, this plugin provides a convenient way to also display the site icon on the site itself, when exactly the same square icon is intended.
